🚦 TRAFIQ – AI Traffic Accident Detection System

Overview:

TRAFIQ is an AI-powered traffic monitoring system designed to automatically detect vehicle collisions from video footage.

The system uses computer vision and deep learning to:

Detect vehicles

Identify collisions

Capture accident snapshots

Generate structured accident reports (JSON)



## ✅ Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLO
- Collision detection using bounding-box overlap (IoU)
- Accident classification with trained crash model
- Automatic accident snapshot capture
- JSON accident report generation


## 🧠 AI Models

- Vehicle Detection Model

Model: vehicle-model.pt

Detects:

    - Cars

    - Trucks

    - Buses

    - Motorcycles

- Crash Detection Model

Model: crash-model.pt

Classes:

['0', '1', '2']

Only "2" class is considered a valid accident.

⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python

- OpenCV

- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

- NumPy

- JSON

- VSCode

▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy

2️⃣ Run Detection (backend/ai-engine/)
python detect_video.py
🎥 Input Video

Place video file inside:

backend/ai-engine/

Example:

accident0.mp4

Recommended resolution:

1280x720
📸 Output
Accident Snapshot

When an accident is detected:

snapshots/accident_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg

Example:

snapshots/accident_20260225_184233.jpg
JSON Report

File created automatically:

accident_log.json

Example:

```
  {
    "timestamp": "2026-02-25 18:42:33",
    "snapshot": "snapshots/accident_20260225_184233.jpg",
    "confidence": 0.91
  }
```



🧪 Detection Logic

An accident is confirmed when:

1️⃣ Two vehicles overlap (IoU ≥ threshold)

AND

2️⃣ Crash model detects class:

2

AND

3️⃣ Detection is stable across multiple frames

This reduces false detections.
